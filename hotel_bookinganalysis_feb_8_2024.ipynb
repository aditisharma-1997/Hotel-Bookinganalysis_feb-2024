For example, hotels can offer discounts or promotions to customers who book early or who book for longer stays. Hotels can also offer incentives such as free parking or free breakfast to customers who book directly with them instead of through third-party websites.\n",

Bivariate analysis: Bivariate analysis is where you are comparing two variables to study their relationships. Multivariate analysis: Multivariate analysis is similar to Bivariate analysis but you are comparing more than two variables.\n",
